The grading rubric will be provided to you and placed in this directory. It must be provided at the beginning of your work with us. As mentioned in the [Student Wiki](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/ghestudents/GHE+students+Wiki), you should get familiar with it so you know what you will be graded for during your stay with us.
