This folder contains two templates for writing the final manuscript. The GHE group can currently support report writing in the following formats:

- LaTeX
- .docx from MS Word with Microsoft 365

Please do not use the Google Doc native format. It does not allow to properly and easily format the following:

- font formatting for units in math mode
- equation numbering
- cross references of figures and tables
- reference management with Zotero

# Computational Competencies

Within the GHE group, we have experience in using R, STATA, and Python. Students are free to use any other programming language for data analysis (C++, SQL, Julia, etc.), but limited or no support can be provided in code reviewing.

# Student proposal template

At the end of your stay with us, you will be asked to prepare a proposal and discuss it with prof. Tilley.  
`Proposal_template.docx` contains the necessary information to make the process of writing easier for you. Please go through it.

# Final manuscript templates and style guides

The outline of the templates is only suggested. Students are welcome to re-organize sections to their specific needs. Sections contain guidance on specific content for the respective section. 

## LaTeX

`GHE_style_guide_LaTeX.zip` contains the LaTeX-readable directory structure for compiling the manuscript. You can use it with LaTeX editor of your choice. We encourage using Overleaf; only there the template was tested for compilation errors. If you decide to use Overleaf, please give the editing access to your manuscript for your supervisors and tutors right away. If you decide to use an offline editor, please make sure that you synchronize your local directory with this Google Drive directory, so all the local changes are automatically updated in remote (and the other way around as well). This way, the colaboration and the review process will be easier.

The GHE style guide is an approved Overleaf template, which you can import to your account directly from [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/manuscript-style-guide-global-health-engineering-ethz/smnzdrqgkstr).

The compiled LaTeX manuscript template is saved under `GHE_style_guide_LaTeX.pdf`. **Please read it**, as it contains all the guidelines and rules for editing a scientific document. These rules are important as they set the basis for our collaboration.

## MS Word docx

`GHE_style_guide_Word.docx` is a template for use with MS Word. If you decide to use MS Word for your manuscript editing, please make sure that you synchronize your local directory with this Google Drive directory, so all the local changes are automatically updated in remote (and the other way around as well). This way, the collaboration and the review process will be easier. To synchronize your local with remote, please use the Google Drive client.

**Please read the style guide** as it contains all the guidelines and rules for editing a scientific document. These rules are important as they set the basis for our collaboration.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: As described above, please do not use Google docs for editing.
