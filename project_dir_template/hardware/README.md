The hardware directory contains two sub-directories: `design` and `testing`.

# `hardware/design`

This directory contains the design files for the hardware you developed. This includes 3D designs, 2D plans, calculations etc. Everything that would allow someone else to reproduce the designs. 

# `hardware/testing`

If a testing rig was built to test the design, it can be documented here, as well as the testing protocols.
