This folder contains code or MS Excel spreadsheets for data analysis.

Please do not store data here. 

**If you use Excel**, link your cells in the analysis spreadsheets to the cells of the data spreadsheets, either raw or processed data.

**If you use Python or R**, place all you analysis code in this directory and call the CSV files from `../data/raw_data` to make `../data/derived_data` files.
