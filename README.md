# student-dir-template

This repository contains the directory structure for new students starting their theses and projects with Global Helath Engineering.

Do not pass the `raw_directory` to students. It contains the markdown files instead of the pdf files.

## How to create the student directory

1. Open the terminal in the `project-folder-template` directory.
2. Run the shell script with the following command `bash compile_student_directory.sh`.
3. Move the newly created `student_folder_template` directory to the student directory. Rename it according to our naming convention.
4. Now the directory contains pdf files instead of the md files.
5. In case you copied the directory instead of moving it, please remove the `student_folder_template`. This way, we are sure to always keep the directory we give to students up to date.
